# Math4AI

Welcome to the Math4AI site associated with the MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam.
This site is provided to help you familiarize yourself with the mathematics needed to become proficient in machine learning.

## Essentials

This section is divided into three parts:
- [**Linear algebra**](docs/essentials/linear_algebra), studying vectors, matrices, linear transformations, determinants, 
bases, orthonormal projections, Eigen decompositions, and similar topics;
- [**Multivariate calculus**](docs/essentials/multivariate_calculus), focused on calculus in
higher dimensions, essentially generalizing the derivative from standard (real) functions to real functions between
higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces;
- [**Statistics**](docs/essentials/statistics), studying the underlying mathematical framework on which all of
machine learning is built.

If you see any errors on this site, please [write us](contact) and we will make sure to address them as soon as possible.
